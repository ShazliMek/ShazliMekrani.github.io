Now, as an ambitiousComputer Science student at the University of Western Ontario, 
I'm determined to be at the vanguard of this ever-evolving field. From those initial steps 
in web development to pursuing a degree geared towards management and engineering,
my journey is marked by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a commitment to making a 
tangible impact in the world around me. Whether it's optimizing processes, designing systems, 
or harnessing technology to solve complex problems, I'm excited to leverage my skills and
knowledge to shape the future. With each line of code I write and each challenge I tackle, 
I'm one step closer to realizing my goal of driving meaningful change and leaving a lasting legacy 
in the world of technology and beyond.
